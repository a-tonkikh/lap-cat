            <p class="questions__question">Why do you charge an entrance donation?</p>
            <p class="questions__answer">Running a facility to house 20+ cats is expensive, and the entry donation is our only source of funding. We charge a fee in order to maintain quality of care for our residents, to pay for overhead costs like
              rent and electricity, and to take care of our staff. Our goal is to make the donation minimal as we grow.</p>

            <p class="questions__answer">Cats sleep up to 16 hours a day at random times. While we understand that guests hope to spend time with playful cats, it's important for the health of our cats that they be allowed to sleep when they need
              it.</p>

            <p class="questions__answer">Yes. However, at least one adult needs to be present per two children (5-10 years). Children under 5 years are not permitted. We ask all visitors to help us create a calm and quiet environment for the cats,
              anyone can be asked to leave (without reimbursement) if they are being disruptive or harmful to the residents.</p>

            <p class="questions__question">Can I make a reservation to visit the cat cafe?</p>
            <p class="questions__answer">If you would like to organize a private exclusive event (e.g. party, gathering with friends, etc), we would happy to see if we can accommodate. Note that we must receive at least 72 hours advanced notice, so
              that we can make the best preparations for the event. Please email <a class="link link--intext" href="mailto:info@lapcat.com">info@lapcat.com</a> for availability and a quote!</p>

            <p class="questions__question">Can I bring my own food and drinks?</p>
            <p class="questions__answer">Although we encourage you to give our locally-sourced gourmet coffee and pastries a chance, you may absolutely bring your own food and drink (except for alcohol), as long as the smell is not strong enough to
              cause offense to other customers and cats. (Otherwise, we reserve the right to remove the food.) Your drink must also have a lid or some other type of covering.</p>

          <li class="questions__item questions__item--closed">
            <p class="questions__question">Can I bring my own cats or other pets?</p>
            <p class="questions__answer">No, as this would pose a potential safety hazard to both the cafe cats and customers. Bringing in cats from outside would not only be stressful for our cats, but likely stressful for your cat</p>
